# Machine Learning in Action: From Fundamentals to Deep Learning Applications in Civil and Material Engineering

Résumé :
This seminar offers a journey into the world of machine learning. Starting with the fundamentals of shallow learning, we’ll progressively uncover how deep learning has transformed the way we analyze complex data. Along the way, we’ll highlight key milestones, emerging methods, and the growing potential of AI in engineering applications. The session will culminate in a hands-on workshop using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect cracks in concrete — a practical example that bridges theory and real-world challenges.
